ps1-esque horror


## ABANDONED
the JS created by this project when run through google's closure compiler is 33kb.
the Haxe version's is 37 and it's a full fledged game engine demo, while this project
only renders a single square in 3D. maybe it's because of the monad webgl? in any case
my enamor with funcitonal languages has gone for now at least.
